# 🏥 Process Flow Analysis – Medical Clinic Efficiency

This project models the patient flow in a medical clinic, analyzing bottlenecks and idle time using a process flow diagram.  
It identifies the process step with the lowest throughput and suggests operational improvements to reduce waiting times and optimize capacity.

🗂️ **Context**

This exercise was completed as part of the course *Service Operations Management* at Hofstra University (New York, USA).  
It simulates a real-life healthcare process where each activity has a different processing time and resource availability.

🧾 The problem description was provided by Prof. Ping Su as official course material.

🌍 **Language & Availability**

This project was developed in English for academic and professional use.  
However, I’m fully available to explain the logic, formulas, and results in Spanish, and I can provide translated materials upon request — especially useful for roles in Spanish-speaking companies or international teams.

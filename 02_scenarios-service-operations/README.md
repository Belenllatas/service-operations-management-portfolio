# 🧾 Scenarios in Service Operations – Newsvendor, Overbooking & Queueing

This project includes three classic service operations models:  
- Seasonal inventory decision using the newsvendor model  
- Airline overbooking using probabilistic analysis  
- Queueing theory applied to customer service  

Each scenario is solved in Excel with detailed formulas and performance comparisons.

🗂️ **Context**

This multi-part problem set was provided as part of the course *Service Operations Management* at Hofstra University (New York, USA).  
It simulates real-world decision-making in three core areas of service operations.

🧾 The problems were provided by Prof. Ping Su as part of the official course material.

🌍 **Language & Availability**

This project was developed in English for academic and professional use.  
However, I’m fully available to explain the logic, formulas, and results in Spanish, and I can provide translated materials upon request — especially useful for roles in Spanish-speaking companies or international teams.

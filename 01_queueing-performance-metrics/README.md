# ⏱️ Queueing Performance Metrics – M/M/1 Model

This project explores the application of queueing theory to evaluate the performance of a single-server (M/M/1) service system. Using Excel, key indicators such as waiting times, system utilization, and average number of customers are analyzed across different service scenarios.

---

🗂️ **Context**

This exercise was completed during the course *Service Operations Management* at Hofstra University (New York, USA), under the instruction of Prof. Ping Su.  
It explores foundational performance metrics in queueing theory using an M/M/1 model.

🧾 The problem and data structure were provided as part of the official course material.

🌍 **Language & Availability**

This project was developed in English for academic and professional use.  
However, I’m fully available to explain the logic, formulas, and results in Spanish, and I can provide translated materials upon request — especially useful for roles in Spanish-speaking companies or international teams.

# 🛫 Overbooking Strategy – Discrete Demand Model

This project models an airline overbooking decision using discrete demand probabilities.  
The goal is to determine the optimal number of seats to overbook in order to maximize expected profit, considering penalties for denied boarding.

🗂️ **Context**

This exercise was developed as part of the course *Service Operations Management* at Hofstra University (New York, USA).  
It reflects real-world decision-making in airline revenue management using probabilistic models.

🧾 The problem statement was provided by Prof. Ping Su as part of the official course material.

🎯 **Objective**

To identify the optimal number of passengers to book in a flight with limited seating capacity, based on discrete demand and no-show probability distributions.

🌍 **Language & Availability**

This project was developed in English for academic and professional use.  
However, I’m fully available to explain the logic, formulas, and results in Spanish, and I can provide translated materials upon request — especially useful for roles in Spanish-speaking companies or international teams.

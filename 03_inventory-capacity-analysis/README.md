# 📦 Inventory & Capacity Analysis – Seasonal Demand & Allocation Decisions

This project includes three business cases related to service operations under capacity constraints:  
- A seasonal inventory decision using the newsvendor model  
- A revenue management case allocating car rentals across demand segments  
- An airline seat allocation problem using expected marginal analysis  

All scenarios are solved in Excel with step-by-step formulas and scenario comparison.

🗂️ **Context**

These exercises were part of the course *Service Operations Management* at Hofstra University (New York, USA).  
They simulate typical decisions faced in services that must allocate limited capacity under demand uncertainty.

🧾 The problem statements were provided by Prof. Ping Su as part of the official course material.

🌍 **Language & Availability**

This project was developed in English for academic and professional use.  
However, I’m fully available to explain the logic, formulas, and results in Spanish, and I can provide translated materials upon request — especially useful for roles in Spanish-speaking companies or international teams.
